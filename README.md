In this exercise, we analyze venues in the different neighborhods of the city of Toronto in Canada. Then, we use machine learning tools to try and classify the different neighborhoods according the venues present in each of them.\\
Information about the venues is obtained through an API communicating with the "Foursquare" application. Significant data wrangling and mapping are also necessary to complete the exercise.
